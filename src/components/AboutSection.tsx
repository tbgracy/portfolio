                Hi, I'm Gracy, a Python and Flutter developer based in Antsirabe,
                Madagascar (but that doesn't mean I'm only familiar with those two
                techs ðŸ™‚). I recently graduated in Software Development at ASJA and
                I'm currently enrolled in Software Engineering graduate program in
                the same school. I'm also an ALX-T Udacity graduate (Full Stack Developer
                Nanodegree). I'm an avid reader and learner. Beside regular university courses,
                I discovered programming in highschool through OpenClassroom's old PDFs (a course
                about the C programming language).
