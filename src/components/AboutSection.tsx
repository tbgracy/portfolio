                    Hi, I'm Gracy, a Python and Flutter developer based in Antsirabe,
                    Madagascar (but that doesn't mean I'm only familiar with those two
                    techs ðŸ™‚). I recently graduated in Software Development at ASJA and
                    I'm currently enrolled in Software Engineering graduate program in
                    the same school. I'm also an ALX-T Udacity graduate (Full Stack Developer
                    Nanodegree). I'm an avid reader and learner. Beside regular university courses,
                    I discovered programming in highschool through OpenClassroom's old PDFs (a course
                    about the C programming language).
                    Asides from tech stuff, I'm an engaged visual artist. My experience in the artistic 
                    field help me to become really keen about small details in design and all.
